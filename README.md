# Big-Data-Analysis-Using-Hadoop-and-Spark
 Exploring Big Data Analysis using Hadoop, Spark, Hive and S3 on AWS Cloud-based Distributed Computing Environment

- Applied skills in Big Data Fundamentals to load, filter and visualize large real-world dataset on cloud-based distributed computing environment.

- Utilized Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and S3 filesystem to handle big data analysis.

- Followed a Big Data analysis workflow, which includes filtering and reducing data down to a manageable size and doing analysis locally on machine after extracting data from the Cloud, followed by further processing using Big Data tools.
